# WEB-DEV-GROUP-19-ASSIGNMENT

Description:

This project is the website for our group, developed as part of the Web Development assignment for our course. The website is created using HTML and CSS, and it provides a basic structure for our team‚Äôs web presence.

What I, Amany Nabil Mohamed, did:
	1.	Updated index.html:
	‚Ä¢	I added the team name ‚ÄúOur Team Group 19‚Äù to the homepage.
	‚Ä¢	Ensured that the file has the necessary structure for a functional webpage.
	2.	Linked style.css to index.html:
	‚Ä¢	I linked the style.css file to the index.html so the page can be styled correctly.
	3.	Used Live Server:
	‚Ä¢	I ran the project using Live Server to ensure the website appears correctly in the browser and the changes are visible.

Technologies Used:
	‚Ä¢	HTML
	‚Ä¢	CSS

Future Work:

The website is in its basic form, and the next steps involve adding more interactive elements, design enhancements, and additional content. Team members can contribute by modifying the HTML or CSS to add features like animations or more styling to improve the website.
